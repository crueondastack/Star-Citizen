# Star-Citizen
Star Citizen Game related content.

I created a Powershell script to delete the Shaders for Star Citizen, after a new release is available. 

If you're like me and dislike manually removing the shaders every release, then you may like this!

After you've updated Star Citizen, and after you've exited the game. 

It's pretty simple to use: 

1. Create a new folder in your C:\ partition. ## I like "Star Citizen Cleanup"

1.1 Copy the .ps1 file into your new folder.

2. Run the PS1 file. ## Right-click Run with Powershell, or Edit to open Windows Powershell ISE

3. The script will close the RSI Launcher, remove the Shaders, and then restart the RSI Launcher for you.

4. Enjoy!
